## Hello

This repository stores the files for an NPM package that helps with installing and removing NGINX Virtual Hosts. 

# THIS PACKAGE IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT COMPLETE! MAJOR BUGS WILL OCCUR!

> **ONLY WORKS ON UBUNTU LINUX**

## Usage
The command will ask for all arguments once you run the main command below. Arguments support will be added soon.
```
nginx
```

## Known Bugs
- Cannot run any sort of normal nginx commands due to the package using the `nginx` command.

## Donating

You can also help me and the project out by contributing through a [donation on PayPal](http://paypal.benwhybrow.com/).
